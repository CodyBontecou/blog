> This is a quick guide on setting up Cypress End-to-End Testing with Nuxt 3.

I noticed [this Github thread](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21184) about users struggling to get Cypress working with Nuxt 3.

I found the setup straightforward and decided to share how to do it.

## Initialize Nuxt project

```shell
npx nuxi init nuxt-project
cd nuxt-project
npm install
```

## Install + initialize Cypress

```shell
npm install cypress --save-dev
npx cypress open
```

Running `npx cypress open` should spawn the cypress test runner. Click `E2E Testing`, then `Chrome` for the browser option, and then click `Start E2E Testing in Chrome`.

## Cypress E2E Tests

During the Cypress initialization, the `cypress` folder should have been created.

By default, Cypress looks for any `*.cy.*` file within your `cypress/e2e` directory.

For simplicity's sake, I have the following test in `cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js`

```js
// cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js
describe('template spec', () => {
  it('passes', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/')
  })
})
```

This test should pass while your Nuxt 3 application runs on port 3000. It just opens the browser and asserts it loaded.

And that's it. We now have Cypress E2E tests running against our Nuxt 3 application. Hope you enjoyed.

Here's the [Github Repo](https://github.com/CodyBontecou/lets-setup-nuxt-3-with-cypress) for reference.
