I'm curious how much time a fast drivers saves over the course of their life. 

- Does the time saved on the road offset the lifespan lost due to the added stress?
- Does it offset the additional time spent at gas stations re-filling the gas tank due to decreased fuel efficiency at faster speeds?
- What about the risk of injury, dying, or car accident?
- Does aggressive speeding and breaking impact the flow of traffic?

I guess the same could be asked about driving too slow. Flipping this over and observing drivers that are going slow might be a fun thought experiment as well.

My guess is no, driving fast does not save you time. *Maybe* in the immediate moment. But over the course of your life, you're just wasting time.

I saw *almost* two car accidents today while driving, both due to fast drivers. They were fortunately quick to react and no accident occurred. But if an accident were to happen, it would have endangered my wife and I. This makes me uncomfortable and a bit frustrated. 

Driving on these roads puts us into a position that even if we do everything right, we are still subject to the actions of others. **It's the selfish ones that are most likely to hurt us.**
