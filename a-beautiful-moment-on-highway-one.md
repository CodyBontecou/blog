Sitting on a weather-beaten log, toes in the sand, surrounded by dried kelp and beach-worn wood while my wife and I love, laugh, sip tea, and enjoy the setting sun on a Thursday afternoon without a worry in the world.

This is the life I have.

I write this listening to the sound of the waves crashing against the shore, bathing in the soft-warm glow of our RV's lighting, while laying comfortably in bed.

This is the life I want to continue having.

Time moves slowly while my body and mind flow fully. I have the time and space to read, write, and love.

For the remainder of my time here on this planet.
