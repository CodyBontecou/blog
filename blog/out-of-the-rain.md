What my dad calls the "Wall of Water" just hit his town. It's a yearly flip in the weather where the rain begins and doesn't stops until spring. Nearly 4.25" of rain landed on them today.

His back yard has been my home for the past month and a half while we fixed up our RV.  This morning, Dany and I were in Putter parked in their back yard. The thought of sitting in our leaky 1977 RV with no sunshine in the weather forecast didn't sound fun, so we decided to drive south with no real plan besides finding warmth.

I'm now writing this on top of a cozy hill outside of Monterey, CA. at the Laguna Seca Recreation Area campground where we can see the stars, staying warm and happy in 53Â° F weather.

## Numbers

Here's a bit of data from todays adventure:

**Gas:** Our odometer started the day off at 37,665 miles with a full gas tank at 9:34am. At 12:55pm we topped off our gas tank with 6.152 gallons and our odometer read 37,747 miles costing $24.60. We ended the day at 3:40pm with our odometer at 37,853 miles but have yet to refill.

This averages out to approximately 13.32 miles per gallon.

**Food:** We spent $24.92 on Panda Express at 11:39am followed by $9.70 at Starbucks at 12:38pm.

**Stay:** Our campground cost $40.

**Total** expenses for today: **$99.22**.

### Reflection

Two costs can be cut back significantly:
1. Stop eating out.
	- We rarely eat out so I am not worried about this expense.
2. Camping in National Forests and/or BLM land
	- This one might add up a bit. Campgrounds are convenient and provide provide which otherwise is difficult with our current water situation (our plumbing system is a construction zone).

$99/day is not sustainable, but today gets a pass. It was an incredibly wet and rainy day with the sole goal of getting to someplace dry. We succeeded and for that I am happy.
