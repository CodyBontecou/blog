A desire to surf cold waves, take 0.5 photos, and see a good friend inspired Dany and I to hop into Putter, our 1977 Toyota Micro RV, and drive down to Los Osos for the week.

We've been couch hopping in Hawaii since mid-January. We went to Hawaii for my brother and sister-in-law's wedding and decided to hang around for a bit after the wedding to enjoy the Hawaiian sunshine and surf while we could. We stayed a few weeks at my moms house on the Big Island of Hawaii and then hopped over to the island of Oahu and slept on our good friend's properly named couch "The Pit".

Oahu kept us busy with work, plenty of surf, and fun with the friends. But even that had to end after feeling like we were beginning to overstay our welcome. So, we came to California to hang around in our RV.

We got to California on the 20th of February after a brutal overnight flight that left Oahu at 11:50pm. We were basically zombies on the 20th that wanted nothing more but to sleep and relax in Putter. But as we were unwrapping Putter from the tarps we cover him in while stored outdoors, we noticed leaves on the roof.

We somehow messed up while storing him and rain was able to get under the tarps and onto Putter - specifically, onto the front window area which has always leaked a bit, no matter how much caulk and effort I put into it. This multi-month exposure to water and leakage left our bed and bedding moldy and wet. We did the best we could to wash it and dry out the area, but it took time and energy we weren't exactly excited to do.

This episode of bed renovating and cleaning took a solid 24 hours of washing machines and dryers running, but, now we're good and our bed is comfy, warm, and clean again!

I spent the following day working on Putter. I checked and replaced the fluids. This included the coolant, which was surprisingly low, as well as doing an oil and oil filter change. I also checked the air pressure of the tires and made sure they were all inflated to a proper level.

By this point, it's the 22nd and we're packing Putter and getting ready to hit the road on the morning of the 23rd. Morning of the 23rd comes and we go to the gas station to fill Putter up before our long journey and realize we cannot find my wallet. It's no where to be seen. It turns out I had accidentally forgotten it in my dad's car which was in Sacramento and would not be back until late that evening.

So, that was a fail. Dany and I were stuck at our home-base until we could get my wallet. 

Okay, round two. It's the morning of the 24th and we were finally on the road with a fully tuned Putter and filled gas tank. The goal was to drive to Los Osos, a town our friend lives in, which GPS states is around 5 hours away from our home-base.

5 hours via Google Maps is really 6-8 when we account for how slow Putter goes, bathroom breaks, and gas breaks. By around 5pm we decide we're not going to make it to Los Osos and decide to camp at Laguna Raceway, we campsite we've been to before. It has the trifecta - electricity, water, wifi, and bonus points for being cheap ($35 / night in off-season). We got there right as the sun was setting and enjoyed the beautiful view from the top of the hill.

Morning comes and we
