I was exposed to Gustav Klimt's artwork today and it was fascinating. I can clearly see how some of his work has inspired many of the video games and shows that have entertained me.

But, what amazed me the most about him and his work, inciting this ramble, was **his continuous acts of creation throughout his life**.

## Years of work

Gustav Klimt had an artistic career spanning from approximately 1880 until his death in 1918 - about 38 years (~13,879 days) of active work.

## Number of creations

In this time, he created approximately:

- 250-300 paintings and drawings combined
- Roughly 54 known public murals and frescoes
- Approximately 4,000 drawings (though many were lost in a fire at Schloss Immendorf in 1945)

That's 4300 known pieces of artwork.

## Average creation time

This averages out to nearly **one creation every 3.22 days**!

## Conclusion

Of course he's famous and produced [valuable work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Klimt#Posthumous_auction_history). He spent so much of his life exploring his creativity and acting upon it.

What an incredible achievement. His story showcases what humans are capable of when they find their place in this world.

He is an inspiration to me. His story reinforces my belief that if you continue to create, you will eventually create something beautiful and valuable.
