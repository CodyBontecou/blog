Those with the greatest ability to communicate their intentions tend to get the greatest number of followers.

Part of communication is broadcasting. The further your message goes, the more likely you are to find a potential follower.

The ability to communicate to people of other languages in other countries is an interesting area.

I'm curious to watch as cultures begin to merge further and faster with one another.

We've had large companies provide applications like Google Translate for years now. It has probably lead to the creation and destruction of cultures such as the digital nomad-ing.

Modern AI technologies has made translation cost much closer to $0 for the individual developer.

Developers now have the tools to create apps that enable their users to decide what to translate. We can translate a book, website, or video in a relatively short amount of time.

It's now possible for individual bloggers to translate their message to over 200 languages. I'm sure we'll see an impact. The economic gate has lowered significantly.
