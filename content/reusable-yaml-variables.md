Did you know you can reuse YAML code?

There are two parts to this:

- The anchor `&` which defines the value of the variable
- The alias `*` used to refer to the variable

```yaml
title: &title 'Reusable YAML Variables'
description: &description 'Reusing YAML variables within grey matter to conveniently generate meta tags.'
meta:
  - name: og:description
    content: *description
  - name: og:title
    content: *title
```

This will now provide the `title` and `description` values throughout the YAML file.

While working with YAML and Grey Matter, I found this very convenient and figured I'd share.
