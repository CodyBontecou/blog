These last few weeks have been a bit hectic for me.

This document is a place for me to put my thoughts down for my future self and hopefully others to get value out of.

## Finding the position

I tend to be a bit of a lurker on Hackernews and only reach out to users that post on the Who's hiring threads. I've had ~~little~~ no luck from these threads.

So, I posted in the Hackernews Who wants to be hired (January 2025) thread for the first time in my career.

This brought a surprising amount of people to me. Around five companies reached out, and I interviewed with three of them. All three of the companies were "AI" startups. 

I put AI in quotes because one of them had a basic chat bot implementation and used it as a marketing tool to say they have AI integrated products. The other two were proper AI companies. One is attempting to build the best OCR product on the market. The other is managing the infrastructure of AI models and giving users an SDK to interact with them.

I was ghosted by two of the companies - both took me through three rounds of interviews before disappearing. The third company sent me an offer after two rounds of interviews.

## The offer

Here's a snippet from the offer I was given for the role:

```
This is what I had in mind and I’m open to negations:  
- Compensation: USD 100,000/yr  
- Equity: 20,000 shares (4-year vesting) - current value is around ~ USD $300,000
```  

I was a bit surprised with the $100k salary offer. While discussing the role during the interview, I was told the pay band was between $100-150k. Getting offered the minimum of the pay band didn't feel great.

The 20,000 ~~magic beans~~ shares were valued at around $300,00. Maybe that's how he justified the low salary? But even then, in a best-case scenario, it's a $175,000/yr offer, which given the risk, was a low offer to me. If this company took off and I was employee #3, I want to have made a life-changing amount of money. Not an amount that is around the average salary of a FAANG employee.

I asked how much ownership of the company those 20,000 shares gave me. **It was 0.002%**. It seemed low to me. But, I'm new to this and have never worked at a startup before so maybe it's normal at this stage (pre-seed)?

## The negotiation

Funny enough, I think my spam filter played some hardball. 

The initial offer email as well as a second check-in email were sent to me via their company email. My email provider (gmail) flagged them as spam so I didn't see the email until a few days after the offer.

I finally received the offer when they sent me an email from their personal gmail account with the words “we’re open to negotiations”.

We hopped on a call and discussed details such as the cap table, ability to exercise stock options after leaving the company, along with a handful of other complex startup related questions I was recommended to ask. It surprised me how with how complicated joining a startup is. I assumed, prior to getting into it, that I’d just be given a percentage of the company alongside a salary and get on with it.

For a group so set on being lean and grinding, it’s surprising how much paperwork is involved. It felt like I was in an arena ill equipped and that I was taken advantage because of it.

In the initial call after receiving the offer, I asked for $120,00 and 30,000 stocks. The founder messaged me the following day counter offering $100,000 with 30,000 stocks and that I will get a $20,000 raise in five months, reaching the $120,000 salary. I counter offered, agreeing to the $100,000 while remote but when I moved to San Francisco (which was agreed upon during the interview), I would get bumped up to the $120,000 salary.

Again, huge headache. We originally discussed the $120,000 during the interview. I don’t like the feeling of having to grapple for every little bit. To me, this was a red flag (🚩), but I convinced myself to be excited and I accepted the offer.

As I was accepting, he casually mentioned there would be a three-week trial period (🚩) to make sure I’m a good fit culturally, with a reduced pay of $3,000 for this period.

This re-affirmed I was being taken advantage of and in hindsight, I should have negotiated for full pay during this period, but I did not after being told this period would be part time and relatively relaxed.

## Paperwork

With the negotiated rates and expectations, I was sent over the eventual contract. This contract was not signed or solidified, but it was sent to me to ask any additional questions or clarification about the role and pay prior to starting.

The majority of it was beyond me. It was full of legal and startup-related topics. So, I relayed the documents over to Deepseek and Claud and asked for their opinions.

Both AI models found red flag and suggested I clarify or alter certain sections. I took these suggestions back to the founder and asked for clarification.

The founder was able to soothe my concern with reassuring words and “this is standard procedure” (🚩) answers.

## Day 1

Work began as expected. The founder walked me through some code and got me in to repos, email, and other misc. tools. During this initial meeting, he casually mentioned how I was expected to work late nights (🚩). 

He hyped me up as we discussed all of the fun and interesting projects to work on. But first, I’d be taking over and finishing some projects their part time dev had worked on.

It stood out to me that there was no documentation or source of truth. Everything was in his mind or the other dev on the team’s. Maybe this is common in early stage startups, but it was disorienting to be a part of. Any mention of this came down to the founder telling me “It would be great if you did this”. Understandable, I’m happy to document and track issues I may run in to while onboarding to help future employees, but I imagine it’s easier for the person with the knowledge to write it down rather than the person onboarding.

Tickets were managed via Notion (🚩) with titles like “schema changes …” with no description, project, or code references. When given a bit of direction of which repo to go to, the commit history was full of commits that just said “up”. I was expected to read through each commit message in an attempt to figure out the schema change. 

I asked questions and got answers. But there was a bit of a “this was supposed to be a very simple and you’re taking too much time” attitude from the founder.
