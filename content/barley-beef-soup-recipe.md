- Mirepoix (onion, carrot, celery) No curry
- Bay leafs and thyme
- Beef - Very important to cube it, toss it in flower and pepper, then sautee it. Take it out before adding vegetables.
- Cook Barley separate
- Parsnip - peel and cube them. Cut them in quarters and then cut out core from each piece. When the parsnips are done, add the barley.
