Having a cup of coffee is like flicking the flow switch to the on position. One sip and I'm in. My fingers feel lighter and every problem that comes to my mind is quickly solved and the solution typed out.

I tend to be very consistent with certain daily activities like running or writing an article every day.

But, if I go a day without drinking that cup of coffee, I feel sluggish and struggle to problem solve.

I've noticed that it's on these days that consistency is broken. I decide not to run or write that article, code is pushed back to another day, and video games or other forms of entertainment find it's way in front of me.

I may have gone three weeks of writing daily, but on that single day I decide not to drink coffee, the will to write dissipates, and my likelihood to break the chain of consistency and skip a day of writing goes up significantly.

Once the consistency is broken, the chance I will pick up the hobby on the following day is near-zero.

**This is my toxic relationship with coffee.**
