## Customer Obsession

1. When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?

S: I built a web application for e-sports and co-stream viewers. It became very popular in the Twitch community. The web app was built to be flexible and work with many games, but I was struggling to monetize it. 

T: The majority of users used it to watch League of Legend e-sports. So, I decided to focus in on the League of Legends user base and specialize the site for them, with premium features that could enhance the League of Legends viewership experience.

A: I focussed my development on features specific to League of Legends. Building features such as the real-time in game stats panel.

R: User's loved it. But shortly after deploying my release, the official League of Legends Twitch account provided a similar experience directly within the Twitch application as well as removing co-streamer restrictions killing the desire to utilize my site.


1. Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation? 

S: While working in China I did a multi-day backpacking trip along the Great Wall of China. My students were doing it for an award and I took that as an experiential learning, to throw them in the deep-end to see how they do, some of the students struggle and at the end of the trip one of teacher gave me some critique on how I could have done better. The teacher noticed kids were slipping down the gravel hills, and asked me why I didn't teach them how to properly walk down the steps, this came as a surprise, what came to me naturally with experience in the outdoors could be a teachable moment for kids that are not familiar with it. This helped me reflect on things I do naturally that other might not know. 

T:  I reflected on the critique and decided to bit a little bit more hands on with future students.

A: I tried to be more attentive to students and apply teach them when given the opportunity. I would teach prior to the activity 

R: I gained a better awareness on my leadership skills and the skills of my students when I should step in to teach. 

1. Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone

S: My friend, my wife and I were camping in my vintage RV outside of a hot spring in the mountains of California, when it came time to leave our RV would not start. I felt really sorry for bringing my friend and wife here and putting them into a difficult position. 

T: We were pretty far from the path so it would be very difficult to get the vehicle towed, staying another night wasn't an option because I have this interview today and my friend had to work, so our only options were to get the car towed somehow or get the car running. 

A: I took a systematic approach and decided to go down the list of what could be possible broken, so first we checked the battery and got it jumped start, and the car still didn't start, then we added gasoline and verify that the fuel pump and fuel system was working, and then we verified that the vehicle had spark. 

R: It turns out it required a jump start and adding gasoline to get the motor running and we were able to get out find and make it to our destination. 


1. Who was your most difficult customer?

S: When I was working at the ski resort in Crested Butte, CO I was in charge of putting the ski boots on the customers. Customers would request a boot size that was larger than I would recommend the reason being in previous experiences they would have foot pain while skiing.

T: I needed to educate the customer that they're foot pain was because their ski boot was too big not because the boot is to tight, when the boot is too large it moves a lot and it causes banging around which causes pain. 

A: I would educate them on where does foot pain comes when skiing, and try my best to convince them to try to use a different size of boot. The costumer is always welcome to try any size shoe they wanted so if they decided the small shoe was uncomfortable they could come in and try a new size, but I would encourage them to try my guidance and expertise.

R: Almost always customers would use the properly size boot through out the day and would return smiling and excited to tell me how the boot work. :) 

3. Can you tell me about a time you obsessed over giving very high quality service to a customer?

S: I built a web application using a new tool called transformer JS which allows you to run local AI models in your browser. The goal of the application was to enable developers to translate their i18n files. I was able to create an mvp within a day.

T:  I intentionally gave myself a month to finish the product to give me time to find tune and polish it. 

A: I spend the remainder of my time creating user experience and user interface flows that I was proud of.

R: I got a lot of comments from users, they were very impressed by the site and they still use it to this day. 

## Ownership

1. Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult short term decision to make long term gains.

S: I lead a team that was building an app for a government organization, we were on a greenfield project that included using their new enterprise Github infrastructure. We were the first team in their organization to move to this platform. There ended up being strict firewall rules were in place that prevented us from running certain tests in our CI/CD pipeline. 

T: Our task was to maintain a strong tested application given the constraints while the infrastructure team figured out how to adjust our firewalls setting to run our tests, which would take months and we only had week to launch this website. 

A: We organized our tests in a way were we can maintain max testability in our ci/cd pipeline and created a system that allowed us to run the remaining test in our local envioerment.

R: We were able to hit our deadlines while maintaining a quality product. 

1. Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.

S: I joined a team late in the project's life span, this project had no deadlines or major features to develop. I wasn't given any explicit direction.

T: I decided to understand the code base and find the pieces that I ambuseded (emvest) to work on as well as most likely to make a positive impact.

A: I started with the tests, I used the tests as a way to map the features that were implemented in a resilient and effective way. I was surprised to find that none of the front end was tested, so I took it upon my self to make a testing plan for our front end web application. 

R: I brought in tools such as play right, and e2e framer work, testing library, react testing library for integration tests and jest for unit tests. I also brought in msw JS to mock end test different UI error states. The team was thrilled and found this work to be beneficial. 

3. Tell me about a time when you took it upon yourself to work on a challenging initiative.

S: I wanted to get further involved with programing communities that I could interact with so i decided to give a conference talk at Nuxt Nation about end-to-end type safety using TRPC.

T: I had to come up with and prepared a talk for this conference while maintaining my full time job responsabilities.

A: I would dedicate a set amount of hours per week to research and better understand the topic that I was going to give the talk about, which I was not very familiarized with but I knew people would find it interesting, and also to incentivize myself to learn because it was also a topic I was interested in learning. 

R: The audience was very happy about the topic  and I was actually invited to do the same talk a few months later.

5. Tell me about a time when you took on a task that went beyond your normal responsibilities.

S: I got very involved with recruitment in my previous company helping with the interview process for new candidates. It was completley voluntary and something i requested to be a part of to help. 

T:  I lead the type-script and javascript interviews processs coming up with creative and technical questions that had to be flexible and match the candidate skills. 

A: I interviewed several prospected candidates and learn from each interview for future candidated so they would be givien and enjoyable interview experience. 

R: Succesfully brought on a few developers that became the companies best type script developers.

## Invent and simplify

1. Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.

S: I regularly write and publish my writing on my personal blog. My original blog utilized a documentation library called Vitepress which is what most Vite and Vue-related packages use. It worked well initially, but became increasingly complex as I tried to make it fit my blogging needs.

T: I decided it was time to re-build my blog using Nuxt.js and their blogging/documentation library Nuxt Content. This let me easily migrate the markdown files I used for my previous blog but gave me a blank canvas that I could build out to perfectly fit my needs.

A: A key part of this re-build required the use of Obsidian to be the backbone of my writing. It's a markdown editor that has a thriving ecosystem of plugins and tools that make my life easier. I needed my blog to be able to be edited and deployed from Obsidian because it then allowed me to blog from any device, including my cellphone. 

R: The original blog that I had used became increasingly complex and difficult to work with. It had many custom build scripts and processes that overtime bogged down my ability to share my thoughts on the web. It took me awhile to commit to a re-build, but it ended up being very simple and simplified my entire blogging process, allowing me to share my thoughts from any device.

1. Tell me about a time when you changed a process at work through either an innovative new way or simplification.

S: A client of mine was curious of the state of the project I was building for her. We would have daily meetings, sometimes twice a day, to give a brief status update. I found these meetings to be distracting at times.

T: I discussed it with the client, and we decided it best to automate some of the status updates. 

A: The communication application we used was Discord. I utilized Github's API alongside Discord's to build a Discord bot that send commit and release information to a dedicated channel in our Discord server.

R: My client was very happy with this! She felt comfortable seeing the updates occurring in real-time. This reduced our meeting time significantly, and converted our daily update discussions into a manageable weekly discussion.

## Are right a lot

1. Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.

S: There's a feature on the League of Legends dedicated e-sports website (Lolesports) that displays match information in real time. Stats such as player gold and build-specializations were viewable there, but no where else.

T: I decided I wanted this information on my co-streaming site that specialized in League of Legends content.

A: The network requests were viewable on their site with the provided API key. It turns out this API does not change and is not user-specific. So, I was able to replicate the API requests on my own site and built the same features that they provided on theirs.

R: Users found this to be very impressive. They had no idea this data existed and were excited to see the site they use provide such a fun and insightful feature.

## Hire and develop the best

1. Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.

S: My job in China as an outdoor educator had a pay system that depended on your ability to perform certain activities. The road block for many of our Chinese staff was the ability to swim.

T: We wanted to help our friends and coworkers progress in their career and learn the incredible skill of swimming. Being from Hawaii, I have swam my entire life and consider myself a strong swimmer.

A: A few friends/coworkers and I decided to hold swimming classes in a river outside of town once a week for anyone that needed it. It became a very popular activity, with many coworkers coming just to hang out and enjoy the river.

R: We leveled up many of our Chinese coworkers so that they were able to pass the swimming at our company had in place. It was a very fun and rewarding experience that has made me some lifelong friends.
