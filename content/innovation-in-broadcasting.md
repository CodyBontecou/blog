The ability to communicate to people of other languages in other countries is an interesting area.

I'm curious to watch as cultures begin to merge further and faster with one another.

We've had large companies provide applications like Google Translate for years now. It has probably lead to the creation and destruction of cultures such as the digital nomad-ing.

It's now possible for individual bloggers to translate their message to over 200 languages. I'm sure we'll see an impact. The economic gate has lowered significantly.
