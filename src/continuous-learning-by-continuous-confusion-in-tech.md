> A key to becoming a good developer is continuously learning.

I'm taking the [Ionic Framework's](https://ionicframework.com/) Vue tutorial, exposing me to things I need help understanding. But each step in the tutorial gives me a better understanding of the last.

While I may need help understanding the content initially, it gives me a repository of codebases I can look back on whenever I need to solve a particular problem. Today, it's the Camera, Filesystem, and Storage APIs. If I ever face these problems in the future, I know where to look.

Continuously following and exploring these frameworks and their documentation to build personal apps is why I am a "Senior Fullstack Engineer." Nothing has prepared me better for work than getting lost in tutorials.
