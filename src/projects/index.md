# Projects

One of the main things that attracted me to becoming computer engineer was the ability to create something from nothing.

The only resource I need to provide is time.

This has driven me over the past eight years to create a number of projects. Some of these projects are for fun, some are for others and some are for entrepreneurial endeavors.

**Timeline**

> These projects are listed in reverse chronological order.

This is just a list of completed projects.

I currently have 193 repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/CodyBontecou?tab=repositories), many of which were made for educational purposes for my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaynjLdmzjkwcsmPN-68iHA).
