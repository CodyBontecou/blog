# Projects

One of the main things that attracted me to becoming computer engineer was the ability to create something from nothing.

The only resource I need to provide is time.

This has driven me over the past eight years to create a number of projects. Some of these projects are for fun, some are for others and some are for entrepreneurial endeavors.
