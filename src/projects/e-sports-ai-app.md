      # E-Sports AI app

> This is a living document used to document my thought process and progress while I build this application.

**{PLACE_SCREENSHOT_HERE}**

## Goal:

Build an application that allows users to utilize modern AI tech such as voice commands and eye tracking.

This application will not be limited to voice commands and eye tracking, but I'm confident these two problems are solvable and provide the most value to a player.

I see this app as more of a launcher that bundles multiple tools that the user may want to use. New features will be added to the app and configured as needed.

## v1:

I'm hoping to have the following features prior to launching:

### 1. Awareness Reminder:

> Sound is played at a set interval to remind you to look at a certain area on the screen.

While browsing the depths of Reddit, I came upon [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYmgW4UkyZU) video. It's simply a black screen that plays a sound at a certain interval. The idea is that every time the sound is played, the user does something.

In League of Legends there is a minimap at the bottom edge of your screen. It provides such valuable information, professional players train to look at it every few seconds.

This feature will replicate the video above with the added option of allowing the user to set the time interval between each time the sound is played.

In the case of League of Legends, every ding of the sound will remind the user to look at their minimap.
