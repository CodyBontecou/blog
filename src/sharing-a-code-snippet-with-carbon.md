<h1 class="mt-24 text-4xl font-semibold">Dev Blogging 101 - Generating a Code Snippet with Carbon</h1>

> One of the first steps to reaching a wider audience as a developer blog is providing interesting, visual content. [Carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh) does a great job it.

Carbon is a simple, single page application built to provide you with an online IDE with the sole purpose of generating codes snippets.

## Controls

It gives you a surprising amount of control over the look and feel of your code snippet, providing the following features:

1. The use of popular IDE themes such as VSCode, Dracula Pro, and Night Owl
1. Syntax highlighting based on specified programming language
1. Custom background color with convenient to use color picker
1. CSS controls: padding, drop shadow, width, font, font-size, line height
1. The ability to watermark your generated image
1. Window control to replicate the look and feel of writing in a real IDE
1. Line number and hidden character control
