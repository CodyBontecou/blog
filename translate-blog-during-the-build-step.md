I should be able to utilize the same tooling for [i18nlocale](https://i18nlocale.com) to iterate over my blogposts and translate them.

The initial translation will require a considerable amount of compute due to the sheer number of words that will need to be translated.

But, once caught up, I should be able to translate future posts during the build step or generation of the site, automating the i18n files as well as the entire blog post.

I like the idea of writing once and scaling my ideas to over 200 languages!
