## STAR

* **Situation** \- Describe the situation that you were in, or the task that you needed to accomplish. Give enough detail for the interviewer to understand the complexities of the situation. This example can be from a previous job, school project, volunteer activity, or any relevant event.  
* **Task** \- What goal were you working toward?  
* **Action** \- Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail, and keep the focus on you. What specific steps did you take? What was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project. Let us know what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we,” when describing actions.  
* **Result** \- Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Provide examples using metrics or data if applicable

**Tell me about yourself / Something Interesting not in CV**

* Most of the past 18 years as DA: Two side-adventures (OSPO & PM)  
  * DA: Enterprise Java devs & Cloud  
* Love to learn & help others learn what I’ve learned  
  * Blog, podcast, videos, presentations, code samples, book, blogs  
* Why side-adventures  
  * PM: Challenges with DA is influence & impact on product  
  * Better understand how product thinks  
  * Customer impact, roadmap impact; what can they not do?  
    * Impact: Kotlin growing (1P & 3P)  
  * SFDC in 2017: Opp to create 2 programs with high impact (Salesforce OSPO & Eng Blog)  
  * Goal: Make Salesforce a more attractive place for engineers  
    * Impact: 2018 \- now top places to work  
* Things I live by  
  * “A prototype is worth a thousand meetings” (Activator, Heroku Button, Cloud Run Button)  
  * It should be easy to create bug-free software that does what users’ need  
    * Kotlin Growing  
  * Developer Experience is a quantifiable journey  
    * Kotlin Growing  
    * Time in flow state  
    * Correlation to time in flow state & developer satisfaction  
    * Journey: interest \-\> evaluate \-\> adopt small \-\> adopt large  
  * Go where developers are and walk a mile in their shoes  
    * Customer briefings, conf, UGs

**Why Amazon?**

* Most passionate about helping developers deliver higher-quality, faster, and more enjoyably  
* Been an AWS user since nearly the beginning  
* Continues to be the best platform to enable that  
* I’ve helped educate and excite hundreds of thousands of developers on new technologies like Heroku, Google Cloud, and Kotlin  
  * On the Cloud side I’ve heard repeatedly from developers that they want me to do what I do, but for AWS.  And I get it.  It is the de-facto standard for enterprise, the place I started.  So it just makes sense that I try to follow one of the things I believe in, which is to go where developers are.  
* Being an outsider I’ve seen some of the gaps with AWS that I think I can help make better  
  * AWS as the established leader, creates a disadvantage \- many options, legacy tech, hard to stand out with new & exciting things  
    * Story telling, going where developers are / ride the coattails  
      * Opps for AWS: Rust & Kotlin SDKs  
      * Stories: GraalVM, Testcontainers, TODO  
  * How Amazon builds on AWS  
    * Differentiator, Trust  
    * Example: Heroku on Heroku, KMP for Workspace  
  * Innovation & productivity that is real / not just marketing  
    * If the AI tech is great, how are you using it at Amazon  
    * Example: KMP for Google  
* Stories  
  * Cloud Run Button / Heroku Button  
  * CloudBowl  
  * Scalable Enterprise Developer Programs  
    * DBC  
    * Content / Advocacy Strategy (workshop, conf, Eng blog, …)

**Most successful project? Most innovative? Highest impact? Proud of?**
